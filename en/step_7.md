## Add more

Well done! You have programmed a healthy 'relax and stretch' exercise program to keep yourself and others moving.

How would you like to improve your program? 

Here is your chance to add some of your own ideas.

**How about adding a new exercise routine?**

You could use some of the **Nadia** sprite's costumes that are currently unused, or even duplicate an existing costume, and edit the costume to make a new position costume of your own!

Would you use the `say`{:class="block3looks"} or `Text to Speech`{:class="block3extensions"} block for the instructions? It's completely up to you.

**You could add controls to change the speed of the routines.**

You could use a new `variable`{:class="block3variables"} to control the `wait`{:class="block3control"} times and how long it takes to `say`{:class="block3looks"} the instructions. You could create more buttons to control speed, like the arrows to control the number of repetitions.
