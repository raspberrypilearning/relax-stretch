## Exercise 2

Now you can control the number of times each exercise repeats, it is time to add a second exercise routine.

--- task ---

Select your **Nadia** sprite and grab a `repeat`{:class="block3control"} loop.

Since you'll want this to repeat the same number of times as the existing exercise, add a rounded `repetitions`{:class="block3variables"} variable block into the empty field.
