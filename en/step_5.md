## The repetitions variable

Next you'll create a variable that will eventually allow the _user_ to control the number of repetitions of each exercise.

--- task ---

Go to the `Variables`{:class="block3variables"} block palette and click `Make a Variable`.

In the _dialogue box_ that opens up, give the new variable the name `repetitions`.

The new variable will appear on the `Variables`{:class="block3variables"} palette and also in the main stage area. 

Untick the box next to `repetitions`{:class="block3variables"} in the block palette to remove the variable from the stage area.
