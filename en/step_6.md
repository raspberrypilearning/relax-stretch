## Arrow button controls

Now it is time to code your arrow buttons so you can use them to change the value of `repetitions`{:class="block3variables"} while the program is running.

Leaving the existing code exactly as it is, add a new script starting with the `Events`{:class="block3events"} block, `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
```

--- /task ---

Now add an `if... then... else...`{:class="block3control"} block from the `Control`{:class="block3control"} palette

```blocks3

+ if <> then

end
