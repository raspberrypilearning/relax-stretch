## Introduction

You can keep yourself moving, flexible, and alert by doing regular and relaxing exercises, including while you are seated. Write a program to help you and others stay healthy from a seated position.

### What you will make

You will create a program to demonstrate some mindful, relaxing exercises that you can carry out while sitting down, and even add a new exercise of your own.
