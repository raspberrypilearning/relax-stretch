## Introduction

Even whilst sitting you can keep yourself moving, flexible and alert by doing regular and relaxing exercises. Write a program to help you and others stay healthy from a seated position.

### What you will make

You will create a program to demonstrate some mindful, relaxing exercises you can carry out while sitting down, and even add a new exercise of your own.
