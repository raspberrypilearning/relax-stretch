## Getting the arrows ready

The next step is to *initialise* the arrow button sprites in the same way you have just done for the *character 1* sprite.

--- task ---

Select the *up arrow* sprite in the **Sprites Pane** and give it a `when flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
```
