## Getting the arrows ready

The next step is to *initialise* the arrow button sprites in the same way you have just done for the *character 1* sprite.

--- task ---

Select the *up arrow* sprite in the **Sprites Pane** and give it a `when flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block.

```

Give the *up arrow* sprite the screen position `x: -140` and `y: 30` by adding a `go to`{:class="block3motion"} block.
