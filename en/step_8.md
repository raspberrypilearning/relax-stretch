## Challenge: Add your own exercise routine

Well done! You have programmed a healthy, sit and stretch exercise program to keep yourself and others moving.

How would you like to improve this project? 

Here is your chance to add some of your own details and ideas.

**How about adding a new exercise routine?**

You could use some of Nadia's currently unused costumes or even duplicate an existing costume and edit it to make a new position costume of your own!

Would you use the `say`{:class="block3looks"} or `text to speech`{:class="block3extensions"} for the instructions? It's completely up to you.

**You could even add controls to change the speed of the routines.**

You could use a new `variable`{:class="block3variables"} to control the `wait`{:class="block3control"} times and how long it takes to `say`{:class="block3looks"} instructions using similar controls to the arrows that control the number of repetitions.
